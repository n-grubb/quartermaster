All-Purpose theme for building clean, responsive, WordPress sites.


This theme combines boilerplate theme code from gutenbergtheme and twentynineteen to create a base theme 
that is compatibile with the gutenberg editor. It includes customizations and features that we commonly use 
as Sailwind.


gutenbergtheme is based on Underscores http://underscores.me/, (C) 2012-2016 Automattic, Inc.

Normalizing styles have been helped along thanks to the fine work of
